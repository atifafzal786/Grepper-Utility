# Description

Grepper is a GUI-based “grep-like” utility for Windows/macOS/Linux that helps you quickly search through directories.

Typical use cases:

- Find folders/files by name patterns (globs)
- Search inside text files for matching lines (regex or plain text)
- Skip hidden items and respect basic `.gitignore` rules
- Open matches in your editor or file manager

Grepper is implemented as a single Python file (`grepper.py`) using Tkinter, so it’s easy to clone and run.

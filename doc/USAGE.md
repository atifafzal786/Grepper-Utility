# Usage

## Run from source

```powershell
python .\grepper.py
```

## Install from GitHub (optional)

If you add this repository to GitHub, you can install it directly with pip:

```powershell
python -m pip install "git+https://github.com/<you>/<repo>.git"
grepper
```

## Tips

- If you have VS Code installed, Grepper will try to open a file at a specific line using `code -g`.
- If not, it falls back to your OS default opener.
